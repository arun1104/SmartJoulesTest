# Deliverables
 ## Swagger Document
 ## Postman Script
 ## Nodejs code with package.json and necessary commands
 ## Sample Unit test
 ## Sample Integration test

# API Flow for Login and logout
1) Sign up
2) Create User
3) login
4) login

Other apis don't have any sequence. We can call them independently.

# Due to time constraints following practices were not followed:
1) Encryption of Password
2) Unit tests for all the files
3) Integration tests for all apis.
4) Strict request body and parameter validations
